Newbie Programming FAQ
======================

Are you new to programming? Has something spurred your mind into `I want to make cool things!` mode?  
Well look no further, this should answer some of the common questions that we get in the programming sections of various sites.

## Note:
### What's this `HF` you keep mentioning?
That's not important; in short, it's a community of sorts where users are under the strange disillusion that they're _hackers_ (in the non-conventional media sense of the word) and that making another stupid clone of the same scripts will make them respected users.  
You can also pay the owner of the website lots of money to get various ranks, which in turn gets users more respect (for reasons unknown to myself), and the power to abuse the reputation point system.

### How do you know what questions are commonly asked?
Good question; it's because I frequent many of the programming sections (`Coding and Programming`, `PHP` and `Python` mostly, with stops into `.NET languages`, `Java` and `Batch, Bash & CLI`) on HF.  
This is compiled from the many questions that I come across daily.  
__Every day__ these threads are popping up in the various sections, and they're just a nuisance.

### What if someone posts these questions anyway?!
That's a good point. Often, these users don't seem to understand that the internet is widely and easily searchable, and it's almost guaranteed someone has asked their exact question before.  
What should we do when that happens? You can do a variety of things, here's a few:

* Link them to the __search__ feature of whatever forum/site you're using.
    * If the site doesn't have a search feature, send them to Google, and explain the `site:xyz.com` filter!
* Provide links to various threads or topics where this question has been asked and answered before.
    * Mention that searching will often times turn up answers, and they should consult that first.
* Send them a link to this document!
    * Nothing wrong with a bit of self promotion, right?

### They're just ignoring me!
Don't worry, newbies often take a bit of nudging to get them pointed in the right direction!  
If you just follow the steps above, and they're continuously provided with the same steps time and time again, it's bound to sink in!


With that in mind, let's get straight to it!
